# SHACL Generator

This tool is meant to generate SHACL property shapes for WD properties, using Nicolas Ferranti's [SHACL Templates](https://github.com/nicolasferranti/wikidata-constraints-formalization)

```
├── query results       # This folder contains the JSON for a specific WD property returned by their query service
  ├── PID.json          # Property JSON
├── <constraint_type>   # Each folder contains the SHACL shapes for a specific WD property constraint type
  ├── PID.ttl           # SHACL shape for a specific constraint type
└── main.py
